# JDSA_final_task

This project is the final assignment of Tomi Mester's Junior Data Science Academy (JDSA), which I completed in 2024. The project analyses data from a fictitious online travel blog and makes recommendations to the business owner on how to further develop the business using the available resources, i.e. time and money, efficiently.

In my solution, I used BASH to clean the data, Python Jupyter Notebook for Cohort analysis and Regression models to predict expected readers, subscribers and customers, SQL for Funnel analysis and revenue data analysis.
